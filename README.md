# Student_management_app

It is a full-stack web application for managing the student data.
Here we have used the Spring boot and MySql database to create backend appliction that is RESTful api.
For front-end we have used React JS.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# Unit test for Front-end React application

In our React application we can see that an ‘App.test.js’ file is already present in the src folder. We will go in that file.\
To run this test, we will open the terminal and type ‘npm test’ or ‘yarn test’. \
You can see a lot of options here to run the test. Typing ‘a’ will run all the tests from the application.\
